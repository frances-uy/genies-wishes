    <h1>The Mysterious Lamp</h1>

    <p>In a whirlwind of smoke and sparkling lights, a genie emerges, towering and majestic, yet with a twinkle of playfulness in his eyes.

        <p>"Greetings, mortal," the genie booms in a voice that rumbles like distant thunder. "I am Kazim, the genie of the lamp. You have freed me, and thus, I shall grant you three wishes. Choose wisely, for these wishes hold the power to change your destiny."

        Your mind races with the possibilities as Kazim awaits your decision. What will your first wish be?
