## Concepts
### HTML and CSS Structures and Attributes
| HTML      | Description                                                                      | 
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTML      | H yper T ext M arkup L anguage used to create the structure of web pages.        |

### Absolute vs. Relative File Paths
__File Path__: Description of the location of the file

| File Paths         | Description                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Absolute File Path | Specifies the complete location of a file or directory in a file system, starting from the root element and including all directories leading to the specific file or folder. | 
| Relative File Path | Specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the current working directory, not requiring the complete path from the root of the file system.                 | 

## Instructions

_Level of Difficulty: Easy_

This is an interactive story-telling platform. The primary purpose of the site is to engage users in a narrative where their choices determine the direction and outcome of the story.

### Before Starting

You may use the same wishes and scenarios created in the sample, however you are encouraged to come up with your own. Create 3 wishes, and 3 branching scenarios that could happen for eachâ€”meaning 9 branching scenarios total.

For each wish and branching scenario, find a special background photo and relating image. These must be in the .jpg format for best compatability. 

Find a picture of a genie and a lamp (preferably with transparent background).

### Setting Up Your Environment in Visual Studio Code

After opening VS Code, create a new file called `style.css` and paste this code:

```angular2html
body {
    margin-top: auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
}

img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```

To preview your site, right click on the tab of the file, then click on "Show in Browser". Remember to _save_ your project in VS Code and refresh your browser in order to see changes you make.

Create 3 new files called `wish1.html`, `wish2.html`, and `wish3.html`.

### Homepage

1. Create a new file called `index.html`
2. Copy and paste this boilerplate code:

```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Link to an external CSS file -->
    <!-- Additional CSS or JavaScript files can be linked here -->
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

```

3. Edit the title to "Genie's Wishes"
4. Create a ``h1`` header at the top containing "The Mysterious Lamp"
5. Use a ``p`` element to make an introduction to how the genie appears
6. Use a ``img`` element to insert a picture of a genie
7. Use a ``h2`` element containing "Choose a lamp to reveal your fate!"
8. Create a ``<div>`` element with the class name "container"
   9. Inside the container `<div>`, create an `<a>` element with an href attribute pointing to wish1.html. This creates a clickable link to the wish1.html page.
   9. Inside the `<a>` tag, add an `<img>` tag. Set its src attribute to the image path, and adjust its width if needed.
   10. Repeat that step for the second and third lamps, changing the `href` of each of those respectively.

### Wish Page

1. Add the basic HTML structure
   - Start with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
      Add the opening and closing `<html>` tags.
      Within the <html> tags, add the `<head>` and `<body>` sections.
2. Fill in the Head Section
   - Inside the `<head>` tag, add a `<title>` tag with the title "Wealth".
     Link to an external CSS file (named style.css) using the `<link>` tag.
3. Fill in the Body Section
   - Add a `<body>` tag with a class attribute set to "wealth-bkg".
      Inside the body, create headings `(<h1>, <h2>, <h3>)` and paragraph elements as required, with appropriate text content. Assign them the class "wealth-text".
      Include `<img>` tags with src attributes pointing to the respective image files (e.g., "images/wealth-1.jpg").
4. Adding Interactive Buttons
   - Create a `<div>` to contain your buttons.
     Inside the `<div>`, add `<a>` tags, each containing a `<button>` element. Set the href attribute of each `<a>` tag to link to the respective pages (e.g., wish1-button1.html).
     Assign a class (e.g., "button-green") to each button for styling purposes.

Repeat this for the other 2 wishes. 

Here is my final style.css file, however it can be modified to fit your design:

```css
body {
    margin-top: auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
}

img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.main-bkg {
    background-image: url(images/silver-bkg.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}

.wealth-bkg {
    background-image: url(images/wealth-bkg.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}

.fame-bkg {
    background-image: url(images/fame-bkg.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}

.knowledge-bkg {
    background-image: url(images/knowledge-bkg.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
}


.wealth-text {
    color: white;
}

.button-green {
    font-size: large;
    color: rgb(27, 95, 21);
}

.button-red {
    font-size: large;
    color: rgb(98, 33, 33);
}
```

### Stretch Goals
- Add alternative options that users can choose within the Wish pages.
